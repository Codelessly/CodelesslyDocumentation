# üñ®Ô∏è Publish your design as a website

Codelessly supports publishing your design as a website very easily right from the editor. Website publishing makes your design/website visible on the Internet. We support publishing to Codelessly's subdomain [site.codelessly.com](https://site.codelessly.com) for easier iteration. See our guide on [Custom deployments and publishing](broken-reference) to learn how to publish to your own domain.

Follow these steps to configure your website publishing and see your designs become a reality.

## Configuring Website Publishing

Once you have your design ready, you need to configure your website publishing settings to be able to publish it as a website.

1. Click on the chevron icon <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to the publish button.

3. This will open the **Publish Settings** dialog with the `Website` tab selected. Under the **Home Page** section, from the dropdown, select a canvas that you want to use as home page for your website. This will be the page that will be displayed when your website is visited.

3. Under the **Publish Site** section, set a custom slug for your website. Use a subdirectory name of your choice. This will be the URL for your website. Note that the name must be universally unique across all Codelessly subdirectories.
4. Click on the **Save & Publish** button to save your configuration and publish your website and wait for it to finish publishing.

After that, you can just hit the publish button whenever you want to re-publish again!

### Publishing on your own Custom Domain

We don't directly support assigning a custom domain to your site.codelessly.com deployment. However, we support publishing with third-party platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) through a [Github Repository](../setting-up-custom-domains/linking-with-github-repository.md). Checkout our [Custom Deployments and Publishing](broken-reference) guide on how to publish with a custom domain.
