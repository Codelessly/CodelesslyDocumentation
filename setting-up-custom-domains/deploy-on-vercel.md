# Deploy on Vercel

This guide is about deploying and publishing your project as a website on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using a [Github](https://github.com) repository linked to your project. If you haven't done so already , checkout our guide on [Linking your project to a Github Repository](https://app.gitbook.com/o/rXXdMMDhFOAfV2g6j8A1/s/x4NeiXalJWaOaV6tsK5f/\~/changes/21/custom-deployments-and-publishing/linking-with-github-repository).

> [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the modern development platform that allows you to build and deploy your websites from a [Github](https://github.com) repository. You must have an active account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) before starting this guide.

1. If you haven't done so already,  [Link your project to a Github Repository](https://app.gitbook.com/o/rXXdMMDhFOAfV2g6j8A1/s/x4NeiXalJWaOaV6tsK5f/\~/changes/21/custom-deployments-and-publishing/linking-with-github-repository).
2. Open [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and login.
3. Skip this step if you have already used [Vercel](https://vercel.com) before. Click on `Continue with` [`Github`](https://github.com) button to start linking Vercel with your [Github](https://github.com) account.
4. Skip this step if you are using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for the first time. Go to `Overview>Add New...>Project`. If you haven't already linked your [Github](https://github.com) account, do so by clicking on `Continue with Github` button.
5. Once you have your [Github](https://github.com) account linked, select the repository that [Codelessly](https://codelessly.com) created for your project.
6. Click on Deploy button and wait for it to deploy. ðŸŽ‰

At this point, your deployment should be ready with a URL to access your website. Follow this guide to [use custom domain for your website on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain).

> [Vercel](https://vercel.com) automatically builds your website when it detects updates to your linked repository. Its all automatic, you don't have to worry about it.
