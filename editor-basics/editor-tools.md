# Editor Tools

The tools panel on the left side of the editor contains a variety of tools to help you out with basic needs of any UI Editor.

When you open any project in Codelessly, this tool will be selected by default.

### Text Tool

Text is one of the most important components of UI. Every design has some extent of Text and styles to communicate information. Text tool allows you to create text for your designs.



Select text tool <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt="" data-size="line"> from the tools panel or use the shortcut `T` to switch to Text tool.&#x20;

While text tool is selected,

1. You can click anywhere on the canvas to create Text that wraps its content horizontally and vertically.

### Canvas Tool

This tool allows you to create screens for your app or website. It behaves like a canvas/frame inside which you can build your UI and then publish it.

You can think of canvas as screens on user facing devices like mobiles, tablets and laptops. A canvas is ideally suppose to fill the screen on the device it is running when you publish your app or website.

While Codelessly is completely freeform in nature allowing you to put anything almost anywhere on the root canvas, it is important that you put your final designs in a canvas so that you can publish them later. UI needs to be inside a canvas to be eligible for publishing.

Select canvas tool by clicking on this <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button in tools panel or using the keyboard shortcut `C`. You can click anywhere on the root canvas to create a template canvas for you to get started with or you can click and drag to create a canvas of your desired size just like how other tools work here.

This tool will create a freeform canvas allows you to put things inside this with position that is either absolute or relative to the canvas.

To move other things to a canvas, just select the node you want to move to canvas and drag & drop it on to the canvas.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you can't put a canvas inside another canvas.
{% endhint %}



### Auto Canvas Tool

This tool also creates a canvas but unlike the canvas tool, this will create an auto canvas with rows and columns. This type of canvas allows you to put things/nodes inside with a relative positioning that is relative to each other rather than the canvas itself.&#x20;

For example, you can put a node on the right, left, top or bottom of another node just like how rows and columns behave in any design system. \

While normal canvases can do this too, an auto canvas is best when you want to create responsive UIs right off the bet.

Select auto canvas tool by clicking on this <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt="" data-size="line"> button in the tools panel or using keyboard shortcut `A`.
